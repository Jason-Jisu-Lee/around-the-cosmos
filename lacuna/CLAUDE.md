# Lacuna

Celestial idle/incremental game. Pure vanilla JS + Canvas. No build step, no framework, no dependencies.

## What this game is
- The **Lacuna** (small dark center) is orbited by **orbiters** that pay stardust (✦) each orbit
- Click anywhere on the canvas to harvest stardust; catch comets for windfalls
- No free orbiters — click to earn, then buy your first **Dust Particle**
- Tone: calm, meditative, slightly melancholy — "lacuna" means a gap or void

> **Current scope (`refine/v.3` — minimal base, rebuilding step by step):** The game
> starts with **0 orbiters** — clicking is the only income; you buy the first one.
> **Economy note:** effects are **additive (fixed +amount/level), not doubling** — this keeps
> the scale from exploding. Multipliers are used sparingly (only Speed and Composition).
> **ACTIONS:** **Star Touch** (8 levels, costs [10,50,150,250,400,600,800,1000], click → 1…9, **+1 per level**),
> then **Star Grasp** (after 5th Star Touch; 3 levels, costs [500,1000,1500], **+2 per click per level**),
> then **Gravitational Pull** (after Star Grasp maxed; 2 levels, costs [5000,20000], each level adds
> **+1% of total orbiter payout to every click**). Click value = `clickValue()` = Star Touch + 2×Grasp
> + 0.01×gravpull×(total orbiter payout), rounded.
> **ORBITERS:** **Dust Particle** (after 2nd Star Touch; buy 5, costs [100,500,1200,2500,4000], **+10 base
> payout** each — all share one orbit on ring 0) and **Dust Particle Payout** (**+10 to each dust
> particle's payout per level**, 5 levels, costs [150,500,1200,2000,3000]) and **Dust Particle Speed**
> (the upgrade runs 100%→200%, costs [200,600,1500,2500,4200]).
> Then **Asteroid** (after 2nd dust particle; a **single body**, one-time cost 1500, **+50 base payout**,
> own clump on the wider ring 1, with drifting dust motes) with **Asteroid Payout** (**+50/level**, 5
> levels, costs [1500,4500,10000,20000,36000]), **Asteroid Speed** (costs [2000,4500,9000,17000,30000]),
> and its unique **Asteroid Composition** (3 tiers Rock→Iron→Gold→Ice, recolors it + payout ×[1,1.25,1.5,1.75],
> costs [3000,8000,18000]). **Resonance** (after asteroid; 4 levels, costs [5000,10000,18000,30000]) is a
> **global ×payout on every orbiter**, +0.25/level (×1→×2), and lights the Lacuna's faint glow.
> **Only dust particles use a count upgrade**; all other orbiters are single bodies. **COMETS:** Comet Charm exists but is **disabled** (`unlock:()=>false`);
> comets still pay windfalls. Prestige, remnants, moons, evolution, etc. are all out.
> Earlier ideas removed: New Planet, per-planet Orbit Payout/Speed, the per-planet tab UI
> (will return once there are >5 orbiters), First Light.

## File structure
Scripts load in this order — each file can reference globals from earlier files freely.

| File | Contents |

| **Core** | |
| `config.js` | CFG constants, PLANET_DEF (ring radii/periods), PLANET_COLORS, **PHYS** (cosmic-flavor physical model). Just constants. |

No npm, no bundler, no TypeScript.

**`PROGRESSION.md`** is a player/designer-facing reference of the early-game flow and the
full upgrade structure (levels, costs, effects, unlock order). Keep it in sync with
`config.js`/`state.js` whenever balance or upgrade structure changes.

**Update this file whenever:** a new file is added, a mechanic changes, upgrade trees grow, state fields are added, CFG constants change, or the save key bumps.

## Key constants (CFG, top of config.js)
- MAX_PLANETS: 8 (only used to size `PLANET_DEF` / the `orbitR` ring math; dust particles use ring 0)
- COMET_MIN_GAP / COMET_MAX_GAP: 25–55s between comets
- COMET_LIFE: 8s on screen

## Upgrade tree (cost ✦) — defined in `upgrades/upgrades.js`. Effects are ADDITIVE, not doubling.
| id | Name | Levels | Effect | Unlock | Section |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| touch | Star Touch | 8 | each click earns tapYield[lvl] = [1..9] ✦ (**+1/level**, costs [10,50,150,250,400,600,800,1000]) | always | ACTIONS |
| grasp | Star Grasp | 3 | **+2 ✦ per click per level** (adds to Star Touch via `clickValue()`, costs [500,1000,1500]) | after touch lvl ≥ 5 | ACTIONS |
| gravpull | Gravitational Pull | 2 | each level adds **+1% of total orbiter payout to every click** (in `clickValue()`, costs [5000,20000]) | after grasp lvl ≥ 3 | ACTIONS |
| dust | Dust Particle | 5 | adds a dust orbiter (+10 base payout, ring 0); count == this level (costs [100,500,1200,2500,4000]) | after touch lvl ≥ 2 | ORBITERS |
| dustpay | Dust Particle Payout | 5 | **+10** to every dust particle's payout per level (`orbiterPayout`=10+10·lvl, costs [150,500,1200,2000,3000]) | after dust lvl ≥ 1 | ORBITERS |
| dustspd | Dust Particle Speed | 5 | upgrade runs 100%→200% (`dustSpeed()`=`mult`=1+0.2×lvl, costs [200,600,1500,2500,4200]) | after dust lvl ≥ 1 | ORBITERS |
| asteroid | Asteroid | 1 | a single asteroid orbiter (+50 base payout, own clump on ring 1); one-time buy (cost [1500]) | after dust lvl ≥ 2 | ORBITERS |
| astpay | Asteroid Payout | 5 | **+50** to the asteroid's payout per level (`asteroidPayout`=(50+50·lvl)×comp, costs [1500,4500,10000,20000,36000]) | after asteroid lvl ≥ 1 | ORBITERS |
| astspd | Asteroid Speed | 5 | asteroid clump speed: base 100%, +20% additive per lvl → 200% (`mult`=1+0.2×lvl, costs [2000,4500,9000,17000,30000]) | after asteroid lvl ≥ 1 | ORBITERS |
| astcomp | Asteroid Composition | 3 | **unique asteroid upgrade**: reforge Rock→Iron→Gold→Ice; recolors the asteroid (`ASTEROID_COMP.colors`) and ×payout [1,1.25,1.5,1.75] (`asteroidPayout` is rounded → integer; costs [3000,8000,18000]) | after asteroid lvl ≥ 1 | ORBITERS |
| resonance | Resonance | 4 | **global ×payout on every orbiter**: `resonanceMult()`=1+0.25×lvl (×1→×2); applied in each orbiter's `payout()`. Also lights the Lacuna glow (render.js), brightening faintly per level (costs [5000,10000,18000,30000]) | after asteroid lvl ≥ 1 | ORBITERS |
| charm | Comet Charm | 3 | comet windfall ×(1+0.25·lvl) (costs [30,80,200]) | **disabled** (`unlock:()=>false`) | COMETS |

`SECTION_ORDER` = `['ACTIONS','ORBITERS','COMETS']`. `buildPanels` renders each section as a
**multi-open accordion** (`.acc`): all sections open by default, each independently
collapsible (state in `sectionOpen`). A section with no shown cards is omitted.

> **Orbiters note:** dust particles share **one clump on ring 0** (the only orbiter with a
> **count** upgrade — up to 4); the asteroid is a **single body** on its own clump on ring 1
> (wider/slower, `PLANET_DEF[1]`). All future orbiters are single bodies too. Each type has its
> own global Payout (×2/lvl) and Speed upgrade. The asteroid's unique upgrade is **Composition** (`astcomp`).
>
> **Component architecture:** each orbiter is a self-contained component in `orbiters/` that calls
> `registerOrbiter(...)`. `logic.js` (tick / orbit payout / buy-adds-body + float label), `render.js`
> (orbit rings + clumps), `ui.js` (combined All-Orbiters-Payout), `state.js` `loadGame` (rebuild bodies
> from levels), and the cosmic info cards all **iterate `ORBITERS`** — so adding an orbiter means adding
> a file in `orbiters/` (+ its upgrades in config.js + a body array/clump in state.js), not editing the
> engine. Each component exposes `list/clump/clumpPos/ring/hoverR/color/pebbleR/payout/speed/make/count/
> bodyUpgrade/rows/labels` (see `orbiters/registry.js` header).

**Show completed:** maxed upgrades are hidden by default. A "Show completed" toggle
(top-right of the panel, `#show-completed`) reveals them; it only appears once
something has been maxed. `showCompleted` flag + `isShown(u)` drive this; the render
fingerprint `visibleSig()` includes max-state and the toggle so the panel rebuilds
when an upgrade maxes out or the toggle flips.

Other mechanics:
- **Orbiters / payout**: two clumps, rendered by the shared `drawClump()` helper (render.js).
  - **Dust** — `G.planets[]`, each `{localPhase,localR,localSpin,pulse,shape}`, travel as a clump on `G.clump{angle,nextTop}` (ring 0, period `PLANET_DEF[0].period`=6s). Speed = `(2π/period)×dustSpeed()`, `dustSpeed()`=`dustspd.mult(lvl)`=`1+0.2×lvl` — base **100%**, up to **200%** at Speed lvl 5 (no base bump). On top-cross each pays `orbiterPayout()` = `round((10 + 10·lvl(dustpay)) × resonanceMult())` (additive base × global Resonance; in orbiters/dust.js). Small grey pebbles (radius `PLANET_DEF[0].radius/3+2`), local orbit 5–12px.
  - **Asteroid** (single body) — `G.asteroids[]` (shape fields + a `motes` array), clump on `G.asteroidClump` (ring 1, period `PLANET_DEF[1].period`=9.5s). Speed = `asteroidSpeed()`=`astspd.mult(lvl)`. On top-cross pays `asteroidPayout()` = `round((50 + 50·lvl(astpay)) × ASTEROID_COMP.mult[lvl(astcomp)] × resonanceMult())` (rounded → integer; in orbiters/asteroid.js). Bigger pebble, radius `(PLANET_DEF[1].radius/3+4)×1.5` (50% larger), local orbit 8–16px; **color = `asteroidColor()` = the current Composition tier** (`ASTEROID_COMP.colors`, Rock keeps `#7a6a55`). Carries 6 decorative **motes** — tiny specks that drift around it at all times (drawn in `drawClump` when `o.motes` exists; much smaller than a dust orbiter).
  - Background is clear (no stars).
- **Lacuna center**: drawn at radius **13** (was 26 — shrunk 50%, will grow later). **No glow by default**; a faint warm radial haze appears only once **Resonance** is bought, with center alpha `0.025 × lvl(resonance)` (≈0.025 → 0.10 at lvl 4) — deliberately barely perceptible even at max.
- **Cosmic info** (`ui/cosmo.js` + the orbiters registry): `cosmoTargetAt(x,y)` returns `'comet'` (within `COMET_HOVER_R`=40px), `'lacuna'` (22px), or an **orbiter id** by iterating `ORBITERS` (each entry's `clumpPos()`/`hoverR`). Orbiter card titles/rows/descriptions come from `ORBITER_BY_ID[id]`; the Lacuna card is built inline (`lacunaRows()` + `LACUNA_DESC`). The asteroid card includes a Composition (tier name) row.
- **Comet hover indicator**: hovering the comet shows a **targeting reticle** — a square drawn only at its corners (tactical-crosshair brackets, gently pulsing, `drawReticle()` in render.js, theme green-grey `rgba(60,80,70,…)`) — plus a small **"Comet"** label (`.cosmo-solo`, the follow tooltip). The comet is **never pinned**; clicking it catches it (the `mousedown` comet-catch check runs before the open-card check). The reticle is drawn in `render.js` using the `cosmoMx`/`cosmoOver` globals.
  - **Hover → `#cosmo-tip`:** a small tooltip that **follows the cursor** (flips off the right/bottom edge), `pointer-events:none`, transient (hides on mouse-out). Hidden whenever a card is pinned.
  - **Click → `#cosmo-card`:** clicking a body opens its full card **pinned in the center of the sky**, `pointer-events:auto`, **sticky** (stays until dismissed) with a **× button** (top-right) / **Escape** (`closeCosmoCard`). Clicking a body opens the card *instead of harvesting* (`mousedown` returns early on a target hit); **comets keep click priority** (a comet within 48px is caught first). The card is slightly bigger and slightly transparent (rgba bg).
  - **Content** (`ui/cosmo.js`): **Lacuna** — Diameter / Mass / Surface gravity / Escape velocity / Density + flavor line (`lacunaRows()` + `LACUNA_DESC`, inline here); **orbiters** — title/`rows()`/`desc` pulled from `ORBITER_BY_ID[id]` (defined in each `orbiters/*` component).
  - All numbers derive from `PHYS` (config.js) via `state.js` physics helpers. Display uses **`fmtNice`** (≤2 decimals, integer ≥100) with a chosen unit so values read cleanly — **surface gravity as “% of Earth”** (0.85%, = g/9.81), escape velocity in **m/s** (142); mass uses **`fmtSci`** (1.81 × 10¹⁹ kg). Orbital speed and orbits/hour **scale with the Dust Particle Speed upgrade** (via `dustSpeed()`). innerHTML only rewrites when content changes (`_html` cache on each element). Base model: Lacuna r=120 km, ρ=2.50 g/cm³ → M≈1.81×10¹⁹ kg, g≈0.85% of Earth, v_esc≈142 m/s; orbiter at r=200 km → v≈77.7 m/s, ≈0.22 orbits/hr (at base speed). Future science-based upgrades scale `PHYS` and everything recomputes.
- **Observatory stats** (`#stats-list`): Star Touch Value (always); **All Orbiters Payout** + **All Orbiters Payout / min** (both after first orbiter — the /min = `Σ n×payout×60×speed÷PLANET_DEF[ring].period`, i.e. payout × the clump's orbits per minute); **Comet Value** (after first comet, `G.cometSeen`); **Total Stardust Collected** (always, `G.runDust` — current-universe total; hover popup explains it resets on prestige); **Time on Current Universe** (`universeTime`). The All Orbiters Payout, Comet Value, and Total Stardust Collected rows (`.stat-pop-row`) show a hover popup (`.stat-pop`). (There is **no** "Stardust / min" stat and **no** rate line in the top HUD — both removed; `G.income`/`incomeWindow` are still tracked but currently unused in the UI.) The DOM is built once per **row layout** (`buildStats`, keyed by `statsSig`) and values are updated in place each tick — so the hover popup doesn't flicker. Rows reset with the universe on prestige.
- **No free orbiter**: game starts with `planets: []`; clicking is the only income until you buy a Dust Particle (count == `dust` level). The click handler always earns.
- **Clicking**: clicking the canvas earns `clickValue()` (Star Touch + Star Grasp) and catches a nearby comet within 48px. **Holding** the mouse button auto-clicks **~3×/sec** (`holdTimer` interval 333ms in game.js; stops on mouseup/leave/blur).
- **Comet windfall**: every comet pays `round(10 × clickValue() + 1.25 × combined orbiter payout)`, combined = `Σ list.length×payout()` over `ORBITERS`; sets `G.cometSeen`. **Rounded** so the 1.25× never produces a fractional stardust amount. No charm factor while comet upgrades are disabled. First comet ~7–13s in (then `COMET_MIN_GAP`–`COMET_MAX_GAP`, 25–55s).
- **Number format**: `fmtNum` writes any number **< 10,000 in full, comma-grouped** (9000 → "9,000", whole — never a decimal); **≥10,000 abbreviates** as K/M/B/T with 2 dp (10000 → "10.00K"). The comet windfall and all orbiter payouts are rounded at the source so `G.dust` stays integral.
- **Upgrade cards** (`ui/panels.js updateCards`): the card vertically-centres the name|cost row (cost 15px, dominant); the **level indicator** (`.upg-level`, e.g. `2 / 5`) is absolutely pinned in the card's **bottom-right corner** (small/faint, out of flow so it doesn't push the cost). The hover popup (`.upg-desc`, slightly transparent) shows just the effect text. Maxed cards are dimmed (`opacity:0.3`) but **un-dim and lift (`z-index:300`) on hover** so their popup is readable — opacity<1 otherwise traps the popup in a faded stacking context behind sibling cards. The right column is **308px** wide (~20% wider than the original 256px).

## State object (G)
Key fields: `dust`, `runDust`, `totalDust`, `orbitsCompleted`, `taps`, `cometsCaught`, `cometSeen` (caught a comet this universe → gates Comet Value stat), `gameTime`, `universeTime` (current-universe timer; reset on prestige later), `upgrades{touch,grasp,gravpull,dust,dustpay,dustspd,asteroid,astpay,astspd,astcomp,resonance,charm}`, `planets[]` (dust particles, ring 0) + `asteroids[]` (asteroids, ring 1) — each orbiter `{localPhase,localR,localSpin,pulse,shape}`, empty at start, rebuilt from `dust`/`asteroid` levels on load, `clump{angle,nextTop}` + `asteroidClump{angle,nextTop}` (the two shared orbits), `comet`, `incomeWindow[]`, `income`

## Sound system (`sound/`)
Split into: `core.js` (Web Audio engine — the shared `SND` state object, `audioBoot`, `tone`, `reverb`, volumes, mute), `effects/sfx.js` (`sfxTap`/`sfxOrbit`/`sfxComet`/`sfxBuy`), `music/tracks.js` (3 procedural tracks Celestial/Drift/Wane + loop scheduler), and `sound.js` (the `SoundSystem` facade everything calls). Internals are plain globals sharing the `SND` object — **not** an IIFE.
- `SoundSystem.boot()` — call on first user gesture (wired in game.js)
- `SoundSystem.startMusic()` / `setTrack(n)` — looping ambient music
- SFX: `sfxTap`, `sfxOrbit`, `sfxComet`, `sfxBuy`
- Mute button (#mute-btn) in header toggles master gain

## Save system
localStorage key: `lacuna_v1`. Saves every 20s and on tab close. Settings: `lacuna_settings_v1`.

## Debug panel
URL: `?debug` (e.g. `localhost:3000?debug`)
Buttons to inject ✦ (100, 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M, 10M), set speed multiplier, force-spawn comets, reset. Draggable. Does NOT appear in normal play.

## Git workflow
- All changes → commit and push to `refine/v.1`
- Merge to `main` only after user explicitly confirms a feature is good
- Remote: https://github.com/Jason-Jisu-Lee/lacuna.git

## Progressive upgrade unlock
- Each upgrade in `config.js` has an `unlock: () => boolean`; the card shows only when it returns true.
- `ui.js` computes a `visibleSig()` fingerprint each frame; when it changes (a new upgrade unlocks), the panel rebuilds automatically — so newly-unlocked cards appear without manual `buildPanels()` calls.
- To gate an upgrade behind a milestone, set its `unlock` fn, e.g. `unlock: () => lvl('touch') >= 2`.

## Vibe coding rules
- Don't change CFG balance numbers or upgrade costs without being asked
- Don't add TypeScript, build tools, or external dependencies
- Visual aesthetic: parchment/editorial (bg #f4f0e8, ink #1a1a1a, Georgia serif, flat/no-gradient shapes)
- User describes what they want in natural language; interpret generously
- After each change, push to `refine/v.1`
- Update this CLAUDE.md whenever the architecture, mechanics, or file structure changes
